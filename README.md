# So I learn Bash Scripting again...

I used to learn Bash Scripting in fullstack dev bootcamp at Integrify in 2020, but I have not had many chances to really use it. My blur memory tells me that it is a pretty powerful tool for automations, so I need to really "learn" it one day. 

## Motivation/Why I wanna learn it properly?
I'm interested in DevOps. I might also very much likely to use it at my current job as a Data Engineer.

## Materials

I learn Bash Scripting from a variety of sources:
* Youtube Video [Traversy Media - Shell Scripting Crash Course - Beginner Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-F3YLd6oMw) - Only half an hour to pick up super basic concepts.
* Book [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html) - Pretty deep stuff. As I read, I practice along and push my work into this repo. Important "components" in Bash scripts:
  * [Sed](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x23170.html)
